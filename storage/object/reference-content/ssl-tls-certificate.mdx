This document contains information to help you create and upload an SSL/TLS certificate to serve your bucket content over HTTPS, through your customized [Edge Services](/storage/object/how-to/get-started-edge-services) domain.

## Configuring a Load Balancer for SSL bridging

SSL bridging allows the user to initiate a secure, encrypted connection with the Load Balancer thanks to the Load Balancer frontend's SSL certificate. The Load Balancer decrypts incoming HTTPS traffic. This allows the Load Balancer to carry out layer 7 actions on the received traffic. The Load Balancer's backend then initiates a new encrypted connection to re-encrypt traffic between the Load Balancer and the backend server, this time using the backend server's certificate.

To configure your Load Balancer for SSL bridging:

- The frontend must have a [certificate](/network/load-balancer/how-to/add-certificate).
- The frontend must be linked to a backend which has TLS.
- The backend server should have its own [certificate](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#certificate).

## Configuring a Load Balancer for SSL offloading

SSL offloading, also known as SSL termination, allows the user to initiate a secure connection with the Load Balancer thanks to the Load Balancer frontend's SSL certificate. The Load Balancer decrypts incoming HTTPS traffic. Layer 7 actions may therefore be applied to the traffic at this stage. Traffic is not re-encrypted on its way from the Load Balancer to the backend server, unlike with SSL bridging. Traffic that has gone through the offloading process is marked with a new header, called `X-Forwarded-Proto`, which informs the backend server that the client used HTTPS to contact the Load Balancer.

To configure your Load Balancer for SSL offloading:

- The frontend must have a [certificate](/network/load-balancer/how-to/add-certificate).
- The frontend must be linked to a backend which uses HTTP protocol.
- The backend server does not need its own certificate.

## Configuring a Load Balancer for SSL passthrough

Passthrough is the simplest way to handle encrypted traffic on a Load Balancer. As the name suggests, traffic is simply passed through the Load Balancer without being decrypted on it. Whilst this option generates very low overhead, no layer 7 actions can be carried out. This means that no cookie-based sticky sessions are possible with this method. In addition, if an application does not share sessions between servers, usersâ€™ sessions may get lost by being redirected to different servers of the group.

To configure your Load Balancer for SSL passthrough:

- The frontend does not need a certificate and can listen on any port.
- The frontend must be linked to a backend which uses TCP protocol, and the TLS toggle should be disabled in the backend configuration.
- The backend server must listen with its HTTP server process on the same port as configured for the backend.
- The backend server must have its own [certificate](/network/load-balancer/concepts/#certificate).
