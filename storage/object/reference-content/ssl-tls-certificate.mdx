This document contains information to help you create and upload an SSL/TLS certificate to serve your bucket content over HTTPS, through your customized [Edge Services](/storage/object/how-to/get-started-edge-services) domain.

### Introduction

### What is an SSL/TLS certificate? 

An SSL/TLS certificate is a digital certificate that enables an encrypted connection between a client and a web server over HTTPS. 

You may hear certificates referred to as “SSL certificates”, “TLS certificates” or “SSL/TLS certificates”. These are all the same thing. SSL (Secured Socket Layer) was the protocol initially used for encryption, though it has now been replaced with TLS (Transport Layer Security).

SSL/TLS certificates contain a public key, which corresponds to a separate private key. The private key is used to generate a signature for the certificate. The public key is shared with clients upon request (unlike the private key), and the client uses it to check the server certificate's signature. Once an encrypted connection is established, the client uses the public key to encrypt the data that it transfers to the website server. The server uses its private key to decrypt the data that has been encrypted by the public key. 

### When and why do I need an SSL/TLS for Edge Services?

When you enable Edge Services, initially your bucket content is served through the standard Edge Services endpoint, e.g. `https://bucket-name.edge.scw.cloud`. Scaleway's own SSL/TLS certificate, which covers this subdomain, is used to establish the encrypted connection between client and host. If you do not want to customize the standard Edge Services endpoint, you do not need to worry about creating SSL/TLS certificates.

However, if you choose to [customize your Edge Services endpoint with your own subdomain](/storage/object/how-to/get-started-edge-services/#how-to-configure-a-custom-domain), Scaleway's own SSL/TLS certificate can no longer be used to establish encrypted connections. Client connections are now initially going to a different domain which needs to be "guaranteed" by its own certificate (despite the CNAME record for the subdomain pointing to the Scaleway endpoint). 

Therefore, when you customize your Edge Services endpoint with a subdomain, you are prompted to upload an SSL/TLS certificate for that subdomain. This certificate is stored in [Scaleway Secret Manager](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/quickstart/).

## SSL/TLS certificate criteria

In general, SSL/TLS certificates can either be **self-signed** (signed by the subject of the certificate, e.g. the owner of the domain) or **CA-signed** (signed by a third party **C**ertificate **A**uthority which is publically trusted). 

**Self-signed certificates are not suitable for Edge Services, all certificates must be signed by a CA.** [Well-known CAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority#Providers) include Sectigo, GlobalSign, Let's Encrypt and GoDaddy. 

Domain Validated Certificates (where the CA simply checks that the applicant owns the domain) or Extended/Organization Validation Certificates (where the applicant must pass more in-depth validation procedures and checks) are both acceptable.

Certificate files necessarily have an extension, commonly either `.DER`, `.PEM`, `CRT` or `.CERT`. 

**For Scaleway Edge Services, certificates must be in `.PEM` format**. The PEM file consists of the private key preceded by a chain of certificates which should look like this: 

```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
(Your private key)
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Your primary certificate (aka server certificate), e.g. your_domain_name.crt)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Your intermediate certificate, e.g. letsencrypt.crt)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Your root certificate, e.g. trustedroot.crt)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

- **Private key**: 
- **Primary SSL certificate**: Issued by the CA for your domain name.
- **Intermediate certificate**: Acts as an intermediary between the root certiciate 
- **Root certificate**: Issued by the CA, for the CA

## How can I create an SSL/TLS certificate?

To get an SSL/TLS certificate for your domain or subdomain, you need to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and submit it to a Certificate Authority (CA) for them to validate your domain, who then send you a signed certificate. You may be able to carry out this procedure via your hosting provider. 

Find below some useful guides from different CAs on how to obtain a certificate from them:

- [Let's Encrypt: Getting Started](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/). Let's Encrypt is a popular, non-profit CA that provides certificates at no cost. Note that the certificates are limited to 90 day validity, and must be renewed (again, at no cost) after this period.
- [ZeroSSL: Creating an SSL Certificates](https://help.zerossl.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060119373-Creating-an-SSL-Certificate). ZeroSSL is another CA, which provides 90-day certificates at no cost, or certificates of longer duration at a price.
- [Sectigo: Compare Sectigo SSL Certificates](https://www.sectigo.com/ssl-certificates-tls/compare). Sectigo is a CA who provide paid-for certificates with a validity period of between 1 and 6 years.
