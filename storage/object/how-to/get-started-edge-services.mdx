Edge Services is an additional feature for Scaleway Object Storage buckets, currently available in Private Beta. You must be [pre-approved for the Private Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/#cdn-content-delivery-network) in order to test Edge Services in the Scaleway console. 

Enabling Edge Services on your Object Storage bucket brings you a number of possible benefits:

- Customize your bucket's endpoint using one of your own subdomains
- Add an SSL/TLS certificate, safeguarded in [Scaleway Secret Manager](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/quickstart/), so your subdomain can serve content from your bucket over HTTPS
- Enhance performance by caching your stored objects
- Finely control your cached objects with cache invalidation

It is currently only possible to enable and manage Edge Services via the Scaleway console. You cannot currently carry out Edge Service actions on the Scaleway API, CLI or other devtools.

Read on to learn how to enable Edge Services on your bucket, and configure your endpoint and cache.

## How to enable Edge Services

Edge Services is available as a feature on Object Storage buckets. It must be enabled on bucket-by-bucket basis.

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.

2. Click the name of the bucket you want to enable Edge Services on.

4. Click **Enable Edge Services for free**.

    A pop-up informs you that your bucket will be exposed via Edge Services and that you can disable Edge Services at any time. Edge Services is free during the beta stage, and you will be notified before it becomes billable.

5. Click **Enable Edge Services** to confirm.

    Edge Services is enabled on your bucket, and its various features are now visible on the Edge Services tab, ready to be configured.

## How to access your bucket via Edge Services

Once you have enabled Edge Services on your bucket, you can access your bucket and its content via the following endpoints

| Endpoint                                | Where to find this endpoint in the console | Notes                                                                |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `https://bucket-name.s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud` | The **Bucket settings** tab                | Edge Services is bypassed when bucket is accessed via this endpoint  |
| https://bucket-name.edge.scw.cloud`      | The **Edge Services** tab                  | Edge Services (i.e. with its caches) serves bucket content when this endpoint is used |

The two endpoints shown above are immediately available as standard. However, With Edge Services, you can also choose to configure a **customized domain** from which your bucket can be accessed. 

You must already own the domain, and can set a subdomain of your choice for your bucket. For example, if you own `beautiful-domain.com`, you can configure your bucket to be accessed via the subdomain `whatever-i-want.beautiful-domain.com`. You must also add an SSL/TLS certificate so that your subdomain can securely serve your bucket's content via HTTPS.

| Endpoint                                    | Where to find this endpoint in the console       |Notes                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `https://whatever-i-want.beautiful-domain.com`| The **Edge Services** tab  (after customization) | Edge Services (i.e. with its caches) serves bucket content when this endpoint is used. The pre-existing endpoints shown in the table above also continue to be functional as before. |

The procedure for adding a customized domain and certificate is shown in the next section.
