Edge Services is an additional feature for Scaleway Object Storage buckets, currently available in Private Beta. You must be [pre-approved for the Private Beta](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/#cdn-content-delivery-network) in order to test Edge Services in the Scaleway console. 

Enabling Edge Services on your Object Storage bucket brings you a number of possible benefits:

- Customize your bucket's endpoint using a subdomain of your own domain
- Add an SSL/TLS certificate, safeguarded in [Scaleway Secret Manager](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/quickstart/), so your subdomain can serve content from your bucket over HTTPS
- Enhance performance by caching your stored objects, to be served directly by Edge Services from the cache
- Finely control your cached objects with cache invalidation

It is currently only possible to enable and manage Edge Services via the Scaleway console. You cannot currently carry out Edge Service actions on the Scaleway API, CLI or other devtools.

Read on to learn how to enable Edge Services on your bucket, and configure your endpoint and cache.

3. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

    TODO SCREENSHOT

4. Click **Enable Edge Services for free**.

    A pop-up informs you that your bucket will be exposed via Edge Services and that you can disable Edge Services at any time. Edge Services is free during the beta stage, and you will be notified before it becomes billable.

5. Click **Enable Edge Services** to confirm.

    Edge Services is enabled on your bucket, and its various features are now visible on the Edge Services tab, ready to be configured.

    TODO SCREENSHOT

    <Message type="important">
    Note the following important information about using Edge Services with the [bucket website](TODO) feature:
    - **Bucket website was already activated before I activated Edge Services**: Edge Services will serve your bucket website. However, if you later want to deactivate bucket website, this will cause an error with Edge Services which will continue to try to serve content from the bucket website URL. You should **deactivate Edge Services**, then **deactivate bucket website**, then **reactivate Edge Services** to solve this problem.<br /><br />
    - **Bucket website was deactivated before I activated Edge Services**: Edge services will serve content from your regular bucket endpoint. However, if you later want to activate bucket website, this will cause an error with Edge Services which won't automatically detect the bucket website URL to serve content from. You should **deactivate Edge Services**, then **activate bucket website**, then **reactivate Edge Services** to solve this problem.

## How to access your bucket via Edge Services

Once you have enabled Edge Services on your bucket, you can access your bucket and its content via the following endpoints

| Endpoint                                | Where to find this endpoint in the console | Notes                                                                |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `https://bucket-name.s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud` | The **Bucket settings** tab                | Edge Services is bypassed when bucket is accessed via this endpoint  |
| `https://bucket-name.edge.scw.cloud`      | The **Edge Services** tab                  | Edge Services serves bucket content when this endpoint is used |

The two endpoints shown above are available as standard. However, With Edge Services, you can also choose to configure a **custom domain** from which your bucket can be accessed. Read more about this in the next section.

## How to use custom domains

### How to configure a custom domain

If you already own a domain, you can use Edge Services to set a subdomain of your choice through which your bucket can be accessed. 

For example, if you own `beautiful-domain.com`, you can configure your bucket to be accessed via the subdomain `whatever-i-want.beautiful-domain.com`. You must also add an SSL/TLS certificate so that your subdomain can securely serve your bucket's content via HTTPS.

| Endpoint                                    | Where to find this endpoint in the console       |Notes                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `https://whatever-i-want.beautiful-domain.com`| The **Edge Services** tab  (after customization) | Edge Services serves bucket content when this endpoint is used. The pre-existing endpoints shown in the table in the previous section also continue to be functional as before. |

The procedure for adding a customized endpoint is as follows:

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.

2. Click the name of the bucket you want to configure a custom domain for.

3. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

    TODO SCREENSHOT

4. In the **Endpoint** panel, click **Configure domain**. The following screen displays:
    
    TODO SCREENSHOT

5. Set a subdomain from which your bucket will be accessible. You must already own the primary domain. For example,if you own `beautiful-domain.com`, choose any subdomain you like and and enter `my-chosen-subdomain.beautiful-domain.com` into the box.

6. Log into your domain provider, and locate the DNS settings for your domain. Create a new [CNAME record](TODO) pointing your subdomain to the endpoint displayed in the Scaleway console. The interface used by different domain providers varies, but creating your CNAME record may look like one of the following examples:

    | Record                                     | Destination                                        |
    |--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------    |
    | `my-chosen-subdomain.beautiful-domain.com` | `bucket-name.edge.scw.cloud`                       |

    | Subdomain                                  | Target host                                        |
    |--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------    |
    | `my-chosen-subdomain`                      | `bucket-name.edge.scw.cloud`                       |

    | Host record                                | Points to                                          |
    |--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------    |
    | `my-chosen-subdomain`                      | `bucket-name.edge.scw.cloud`                       |


7. Back in the Scaleway console, click the `Verify CNAME` button to check whether your CNAME record has been correctly configured. Edge Services will carry out a check, and if it is successful the following message displays:

      <Lightbox src="scaleway-cname-success.webp" alt="Verification passed: Your DNS record has been correctly configured" />

      If the check fails, an error message will display. Check out our [dedicated troubleshooting guide](TODO) for help fixing this issue.

8. Provide an SSL/TS certificate for your subdomain so that it can serve traffic over HTTPS. You have two options for this:
    - Select an existing certificate that you have stored in [Scaleway Secret Manager](/identity-and-access-management/secret-manager/quickstart/).
    - Manually import a certificate into Scaleway Secret Manager:
      - Enter a name for your certificate (alphanumeric characters only)
      - Optionally, add tags by typing each tag and then pressing enter
      - Copy and paste the full PEM-formatted certificate chain into the box.
      Your certificate will be automatically stored in Secret Manager and billed accordingly. For Edge Services Private Beta testers, a credit of TODO will be applied to your Scaleway account for Secret Manager storage.

    For help with creating an an SSL/TLS certificate, and/or dealing with any errors you encounter when importing it into Secret Manager, see our [dedicated documentation](TODO)
    </Message>

9. Click **Customize domain** to finish.

Your customized domain is set up, and you are returned to the Edge Services dashboard. The customized domain displays in the Endpoint panel. When you access your bucket through this domain, it's content will be served via Edge Services.

### How to edit your customized domain or its certificate

After customizing your domain, you can edit it (or its certficate) at any time as follows:

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.

2. Click the name of the bucket you want to configure a custom domain for.

3. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

    TODO SCREENSHOT

4. In the **Endpoint** panel, click **Edit**. The following screen displays:

    TODO SCREENSHOT

5. Edit the subdomain as desired - do not forget to also set up a new CNAME record if necessary. 

6. Select a different certificate from Secret Manager, or manually import a new certificate for your custom domain.

7. Click **Edit domain** to finish.

### How to reset your customized domain to the original Edge Services endpoint

Even though the original Edge Services endpoint (e.g. `https://bucket-name.edge.scw.cloud`) will continue to work after you add a customized domain, you can choose to remove your customized domain completely and go back to the original Edge Services endpoint only. This is done via the reset function:

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.

2. Click the name of the bucket you want to configure a custom domain for.

3. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

    TODO SCREENSHOT

4. In the **Endpoint** panel, click **Reset**. 

    A screen displays warning you that this will reset the bucket's domain back to the default Edge Services endpoint. Edge Services will consider your customized subdomain as unknown. You should also remember to delete your CNAME record from your domain provider, and your SSL/TLS certificate.

5. Click **Reset domain** to finish.

## How to configure your cache

The cache feature allows you to cache your bucket's content with Edge Services. This means that content can be served directly to users from Edge Services' servers, enhancing performance. You can disable and enable caching at will, as well as control the lifetime of an object in the cache, and purge your cache at any time.

### How to enable your cache

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.

2. Click the name of the bucket you want to configure a cache for.

3. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

    TODO SCREENSHOT

4. In the **Cache** panel, use the <Icon name="toggle" /> icon to enable the cache.

    The **Lifetime** configuration box displays. This enables you to define, in hours, how long an object can be stored in the cache before it must be retrieved freshly from the bucket.

5. Leave the default value of TODO in place, or enter another value between TODO and TODO.

### How to purge your cache

Purging your cache removes objects from it. Afterwards, they must be freshly retrieved from the bucket before being stored again in the cache. You can either purge everything in the cache, or specify the URL of precise objects to be purged.

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.

2. Click the name of the bucket you want to purge the cache for.

3. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

    TODO SCREENSHOT

4. In the **Purge cache** panel, choose one of the following options:
    - Click **Purge all**. A screen displays warning you that everything in your cache will be purged. Click **Purge cache** to confirm.
    - Click **Purge by URL**. A screen displays prompting you to enter the content path for each object you want to purge. Add as many paths as you like, and click **Purge cache** to confirm.

    <Message type="tip">
    Add info about content path
    </Message>

    You are returned to the Edge Services dashboard. You can view purge events in the log displayed in the **Purge cache** panel.

### How to disable your cache

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.

2. Click the name of the bucket you want to disable caching for.

3. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

    TODO SCREENSHOT

4. In the **Cache** panel, use the <Icon name="toggle" /> icon to disable the cache.

    Your cache is disabled. Content will be served directly from your Object Storage bucket.

## How to disable Edge Services

You can disable Edge Services at any time via the following procedure:

1. Click **Object Storage** in the **Storage** section of the side menu. The list of your buckets displays.

2. Click the name of the bucket you want to disable the cache on.

3. Click the **Edge Services** tab.

    TODO SCREENSHOT

    A pop-up displays, informing you that the bucket will be removed from Edge Services.
      - The bucket will no longer be accessible via its Edge Services endpoint, or any customized domains pointing to this endpoint.
      - Any files stored in the Edge Services cache will be removed.
    
    <Message type="tip">
    Remember to delete the CNAME record with your domain provider, and your SSL/TLS certificate for the custom domain.
    </Message>

5. Click **Disable Edge Services**.

    Edge Services is disabled. You can enable it again at any time, but you will need to reconfigure your custom domain, and the cache will initially be empty.
